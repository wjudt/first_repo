## Hello everyone!
My name is Wojciech Judt. I try to explore the secrets of data exploration. I am interested in application of data engineering tools in real life. I want to show you what i have done so far :).

### First project - cleaning computer jobs offers (python v. 3.8, pandas v. 1.4.3, v. matplotlib v. 3.3.4)
My first project is connected with clearing a raw dataset, which I found at kaggle.com. Mentioned dataset contains 622 computer job offers scraped from glassdoor.com. I read raw data from .csv file, then cleaned them. I prepared this dataset also for doing some simple data science on it. After that I showed some crucial information about the dataset on a few charts. After that cleaned dataset was written to a new .csv file for further use.
